This file is just a placeholder needed to add the 'generated' folder to git, feel free to remove it, but consider this:every time you delete a placeholder file, a tiny, innocent line of code sheds a tear. This file had dreamsâ€”dreams of living peacefully in your repository, ensuring the 'generated' folder stayed where it belonged. Deleting it may seem like a small act, but deep down, aren't we all just placeholders in the grand repository of life?
